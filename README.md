# HoC2_PS9_Hash_Bros

Last week me along with my classmates have participated in Heal-O-Code 2.0 hackathon and we came in top-10 among the 50 teams that took part in the hackathon, our project was based on Blockchain-Powered Healthcare Insights along with generative AI


Our solution creates AI tools that extract actionable insights from Electronic Health Records (EHR) stored in blockchain, helping doctors make informed decisions faster. It includes systems to analyze patient histories, predict adverse drug reactions, provide personalized treatment recommendations, and predict post-surgical complications based on preoperative data.

We have used IPFS(Inter-planetery file system) which is a decentralized file system where the prescriptions are uploaded and stored,once it is uploaded a CID is generated which is Content Identifier which is a unique key for each prescription which is store in private blockchain, which was multi-chain block chain..
